# 4516CSQR-GlobalEnergy-Group-1-
This branch contains the data filtering and my visualization work for the Global Renewable Energy Usage dataset. The dataset used was cleaned and prepared by Nafisa and Bahja before creating visual insights, and this branch includes both the cleaned data processing file and the final visualizations.

This branch contains two main files:
    1.	Data Filtering and Cleaning
      The dataset was cleaned and filtered using Python to remove missing values and prepare it for analysis. This task was completed by both Nafisa and Bahja.
      The cleaned dataset was saved and used directly in the visualizations.

    2.	Data Visualizations
      Two charts were created using the cleaned data:
          •	Average Monthly Energy Usage by Income Group 
           Visualizes how Low, Middle, and High income households compare in renewable energy usage from 2020–2024.
           
          •	Urban vs Rural Average Monthly Usage Over Time 
           Shows how renewable energy usage in urban and rural areas has changed between 2020 and 2024.

Libraries Used
•	Pandas – for reading CSV files, grouping, and calculating mean values
•	Matplotlib – for creating the bar chart and line chart visualizations
•	NumPy – used implicitly for numerical operations (if needed during cleaning)
