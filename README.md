# 4516CSQR-GlobalEnergy-Group-1-
Data visualization group project on renewable energy usage 
The Python scripts EMAN-visualisation-feature1.py and EMAN-visualisation-feature2.py, along with the Cleaned and filtered dataset .csv file, should be downloaded and stored within the same directory to ensure seamless execution. Once the files are properly placed, the folder should be opened in Visual Studio Code, with all three files loaded accordingly. Each script is intended to be executed without debugging, and both are expected to run without errors, generating two distinct visualisation graphs. For academic presentation and verification purposes, the graphical outputs generated by each script are also available as images on my personal GitHub branch.
